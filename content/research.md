## Thermalization probes of quantum many body systems
- Probing Thermalization through Spectral Analysis with Matrix Product Operators, **Yilun Yang**, *Sofyan Iblisdir, J. Ignacio Cirac, and Mari Carmen Ba√±uls*, [PhysRevLett.124.100602](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.100602) ([poster](/files/posters/slides_VaQuM_Yilun_Yang.pdf))

We provide a technique for spectral analysis of quantum many body systems with tensor networks, which can be applied to detect both initial state thermalization and energy eigenstate thermalization.
